# 40 Pieces RAM Tray

---

You can find this model on [makerworld](https://makerworld.com/it/models/2287316-dimm-sodimm-40-tray#profileId-2495216).  

I could not find ram trays bigger than 20 or 25, so I made one. Has both a DIMM and SODIMM version.

Made using Fusion360, measures based on standard stick dimensions ( SODIMM 69.6mm; DIMM 133.35mm )

*Is stackable!*
